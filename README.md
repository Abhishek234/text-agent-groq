## Configuration

The script uses the following default settings:
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Max tokens**: 150 (for summary length)
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (for consistent output)

You can modify these settings in the `summarize_email()` function in `main.py`.

## Error Handling

The script handles various error scenarios:
- Missing or invalid API key
- Network connectivity issues
- Rate limiting
- API errors
- Invalid input

## Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- The script doesn't store your API key locally

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed" error**:
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account

**"Rate limit exceeded" error**:
- Wait a moment and try again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan if this happens frequently

**"No module named 'openai'" error**:
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
